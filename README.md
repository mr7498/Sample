# Code Documentation

This repository contains code that performs various operations on user prompts. The code is divided into several functions, each serving a specific purpose.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- re
- nltk

## Steps

### Step 1: Importing necessary libraries

The required libraries are imported at the beginning of the code to enable their usage throughout the program.

### Step 2: Validating user prompts

There are functions implemented to validate user prompts based on different conditions. These functions ensure the correctness of the input data.

### Step 3: Extracting model type code

This step includes a function that extracts the model type code from the input data.

### Step 4: Identifying first and last index

A function is implemented to identify the first and last index of a given text.

### Step 5: Evaluating boolean expressions

A function is provided to evaluate a boolean expression and convert it into a standardized format.

### Step 6: Declaring a dictionary for respective keys

A dictionary is declared to store respective keys for the final boolean expression.

### Step 7: Generating the final boolean expression

A function is implemented to generate the final boolean expression using the previously defined functions.

### Step 8: Extracting date in YYYY-MM-DD format

A function is available to extract the year, month, and day from the text and return it in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

### Step 9: Generating the final request body

This step involves calling all the functions mentioned above to generate the final request body.

### Step 10: Testing the code

The code prompts the user to enter the number of prompts they want to insert. Then, it asks for the input text and provides the respective output for each prompt.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries mentioned in the prerequisites section.
2. Run the code and provide the necessary input when prompted.
3. Review the output generated for each prompt.
